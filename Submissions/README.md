Matthew Sredojevic README.md
I'm not entierly sure what else needs to be put in here besides potential bells and whistles.

Intended Bells/Whistles

1)Bell: Tooltips (because the initial guide for appending text was talking about tooltips, ezpz)

2)Bell: Style visualization (shouldn't be too hard, just grab some bg-images and some colors. F U T U R E squidward.gif)

3)Bell: Best Fit Lines (again, can't be too hard)

4)Whistle: Transition (should more or less be instead of direct name, change a variable name to be the path and use that to call the d3.svg calls)

5)Replication (holy baloney this would take like 20 minutes i feel. Like cake, like if you know how to use Tableau, youre good, fam)

totaling out at like 16 extra credit points. But how is the grade determined? :thinking:
YO HOLY SHIT EMOTES WORK :ok_hand:
